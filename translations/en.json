  "companyTitle": "Company Site",
  "companyDescription": "For this project, I designed and developed a modern, responsive website for a fictional web development agency, showcasing both my UI/UX design skills and front-end development abilities. I created the layout and visual identity from scratch, focusing on clean typography, clear hierarchy, and a professional aesthetic. The site was built using HTML 5, CSS 3, and Bootstrap 5, with responsive behavior optimized for various screen sizes. Key features include a services section, animated transitions, and a contact formâ€”all styled consistently to maintain a cohesive brand feel. This project demonstrates my ability to take a concept from initial design through to fully functional deployment.",
